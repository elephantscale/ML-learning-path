# Resources for Learning Python

## Part 1 : Core Python

### 1.1 : Learn
There are tons of resources for learning Python.  Here are a few
- Start with this one :
[Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) - FREE, very good intro book
- Then try this : [Dive into python](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/): FREE, more detailed good 2nd book
- [Learn Python3 the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)
- [Google python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?csw=1) - popular online class


### 1.2 - Practice, Practice and Practice
The best way to get comfortable in a language is to practice.  
Try the following exercises.   
Remember,  you can do them in any order..there is no sequence to follow   

- Try these exercises : https://github.com/elephantscale/learning-coding –  we have created this to learn a language quickly
- [Python cookbook](https://github.com/ActiveState/code)— very comprehensive code snippets
- [w3 python exercises](http://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)– very comprehensive
- [Python module of the week](https://pymotw.com/3/)
- https://github.com/karan/Projects
